# Practical Session 02

## Requirements

* Setting up your computer with a Linux or macOS operating system (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Install Conda and Jupyter Lab (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Install Biopython library (also see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Complete the practical session 01

## To begin

In this session, we will continue the work we left in the previous practice session (01) of reading and dealing with sequence information. Here we introduce how to write python functions and we used them to reuse the code and make cleaner programs.

Some basic Python concepts about functions are needed, so please review them before the session:

- [Python function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm)

To start the session, you'll need the files inside the P02 folder in this repository. To do that is better to have the full repository cloned in your computer:

On your terminal, navigate to a location where you want to download the course repository. This location should be different than the one sed to clone the repository of the practical session 01. Go to another location and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics.git
```

This command will create a folder named "Introduction-to-Bioinformatics" containing the full repository at its latest version.

Navigate to the Practical Session 01 directory:

```
cd Introduction-to-Bioinformatics/practical/P02
```

And open the Jupyter notebook inside this folder:

```
jupyter-notebook 02-PairwiseAlignment.ipynb
```

The content of this notebook can also be consulted at the following link:
