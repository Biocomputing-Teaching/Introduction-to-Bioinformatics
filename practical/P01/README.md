# Practical Session 01

## Requirements 

* Setting up your computer with Linux or macOS operating system (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Install Conda and Jupyter Lab (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Complete the "Learn the Basics" entries in the [Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/en/)

## To begin

In this session, we will start working with sequence data using Python. It is imperative to have completed the basic parts of the Python tutorial. Here we will see the code at work by reading files and doing calculations using python string objects.

Some basic python concepts are needed, so please review them before the session:

- Python data
- Data types
- Python function
- Python method
- Line break

To start the session, you'll need the files inside the P01 folder in this repository. To do that is better to have the full repository cloned in your computer: on your terminal, navigate to a location where you want to download the course repository and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics.git
```

This command will create a folder named "Introduction-to-Bioinformatics" containing the full repository at its latest version.

Navigate to the Practical Session 01 directory:

```
cd Introduction-to-Bioinformatics/practical/P01
```

And open the jupyter notebook inside the folder:

```
jupyter-notebook 01-WorkingWithFastaFiles.ipynb
```
