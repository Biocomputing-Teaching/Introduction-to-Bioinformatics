# Practical Session 02

## Requirements

* Setting up your computer with a Linux or macOS operating system (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Install Conda and Jupyter Lab (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Complete the "Learn the Basics" entries in the [Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/en/)

## To begin

In this session, we will start working with sequence data using Python. It is imperative to have completed the basic parts of the Python tutorial given. Here we will see the code at work by reading files and doing basic string manipulations using Python.

Some basic Python concepts are needed, so please review them before the session:

- [Python Data Types](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm)
- [Python function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm)

To start the session, you'll need the files inside the P01 folder in this repository. To do that is better to have the full repository cloned in your computer:

On your terminal, navigate to a location where you want to download the course repository and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics.git
```

This command will create a folder named "Introduction-to-Bioinformatics" containing the full repository at its latest version.

Navigate to the Practical Session 01 directory:

```
cd Introduction-to-Bioinformatics/practical/P01
```

And open the Jupyter notebook inside this folder:

```
jupyter-notebook 01-WorkingWithFastaFiles.ipynb
```

The content of this notebook can also be consulted at the following link:
