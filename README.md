# Introduction to Bioinformatics

## Welcome to the course!

This page is the official repository for the course "Introduction to Bioinformatics" of the Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Science (Biomedicine) at the UIC.

The repository contains the material created or adapted from other (referred) sources for a first introduction to the field of Bioinformatics, using Python and R programming languages. 

## Getting started

To work in bioinformatics means to work with computers. As a necessary step, you'll need to learn how to use computers to get insight from biological data. By "use computers," we mean to grasp the full potential that computers can offer to assist you in gathering, creating, and analyzing data. These tasks are achievable at their best by learning to write your own programs; they will suit the specific needs to answer your questions. We will learn how to make small scripts along with the content of the course. However, most programming learning will be part of your own effort; programming is a language, we can show you how it works, but it is up to you how you speak it and use it.
