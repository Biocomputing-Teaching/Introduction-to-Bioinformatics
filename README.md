# Introduction to Bioinformatics

## Welcome to the course!

This page is the official repository for the course "Introduction to Bioinformatics" of the Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Science (Biomedicine) at the UIC.

The repository contains the material created or adapted from other (referred) sources for a first introduction to the field of Bioinformatics, using Python and R programming languages. 

## Getting started

To work in bioinformatics means to work with computers. As a necessary step, you'll need to learn how to use computers to get insight from biological data. By "use computers," we mean to grasp the full potential that computers can offer to assist you in gathering, creating, and analyzing data. These tasks are achievable at their best by learning to write your own programs, so they will suit the specific needs to answer your scientific questions. We will learn how to make small scripts along with the content of the course. However, most programming learning will be part of your own effort; programming is a language, we can show you how it works, but it is up to you how you learn it, speak it, and put it to good use.

### Preparing the tools

Before we start with the course's practical session, you must have everything set up and ready to work. Our primary language will be Python, a general programming language that is more ubiquitous by every day. Many platforms can host a python interpreter, but since this is not the only application we will use in this course, we will need a shared operating system among all the course attendants. For this, we choose Linux since most of the scientific applications are developed for it.

Linux and macOS are very similar since both have similar architectures. Many Linux programs are also available for macOS users...

There are several ways to install Linux. One way is using it as your primary operating system, doing everything you usually do but now using Linux.

Also, there are ways of having more than one operating system in your personal computer that you can select at the startup menu (when you turn on your computer). If you have a Windows computer, this could be an option.

Finally, if you don't want a second operative system on your computer, you can just set up a Linux virtual box. 

### Installing the required programs

We will need to install the Conda package manager:

After installing Conda, we will install the Jupyter-lab package:

That's it for now. Although, during the course, we will install and create other programming packages when we need them.

## Sessions

The course will be divided into theoretical, practical, and methodological cases. Here, you will find the necessary information for each one of those sessions:

### Theoretical sessions

### Practical Sessions

### Case Sessions
